        <h4>Who are we?</h4>
        <p>
          We're an enthusiastic group of developers from Haifa. Some of us are
          professionals, some are still learning, but all of us agree upon one
          thing: Haifa offers barely enough for local developers to thrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody wants to move far away from the place they call home just to
          establish a career. We don't think anyone should. That's why we've
          established Haife:Dev, so that all of Haifa's developers will have{" "}
          <b>a reason to stay in Haifa</b>.

        <p>To allow ourselves and others a fulfilling career as software developers without having to move elsewhere.</p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to bring professional software-related content to Haifa{" "}
          <b>for free</b>. We aim to organize meetups and other events that can
          help developers in (and around) Haifa develop their career without the need to
          travel accross the country.
